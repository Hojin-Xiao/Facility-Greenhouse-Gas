Compared with the missing values in Address and Post Code, the missing values in City are less and sparser. This data missing pattern makes sense because the three columns are all about geospatial features of the facilities. More precisely, if the city of one greenhouse gas emissions facility is missing, then the more detailed address and post code of such facility will also be missing for certain. On the other hand, even if the city is not missing, the specific address and post code of the facility could still be missing.\nThe missing values in Dataset 2 are distributed across almost all features. Hence, we decided to observe the data missing pattern with respect to each province in Canada\n\n\nCode\nProvinces &lt;- unique(Fac_emis$`Facility Province or Territory / Province ou territoire de l'installation`)\nProvince_missing &lt;- c()\nNum_of_Reports &lt;- c()\n\nfor (j in Provinces) {\n  Province_missing &lt;- append(Province_missing, sum(is.na(Fac_emis[Fac_emis$`Facility Province or Territory / Province ou territoire de l'installation` == j, ])))\n  Num_of_Reports &lt;- append(Num_of_Reports, nrow(Fac_emis[Fac_emis$`Facility Province or Territory / Province ou territoire de l'installation` == j, ]))\n}\n\n\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(Provinces, Province_missing, Num_of_Reports)\nggplot(df, aes(x = Province_missing, y = fct_reorder(factor(Provinces), \n                                                     Province_missing))) +\n  geom_col(fill='cornflowerblue') +\n  xlab(\"Missing Value Count\") +\n  ylab(\"Provinces\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Pattern in Missing values based on Canadian Provinces\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(color = \"cornflowerblue\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is, we can see the missing values are mainly from 5 Canadian provinces: Alberta, Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, Saskatchewan. However, if we count the number of filed facility emission reports from each province:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = Num_of_Reports, y = fct_reorder(factor(Provinces), \n                                                     Num_of_Reports))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  xlab(\"Number of Facility Emission Reports\") +\n  ylab(\"Provinces\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Number of Facility Emission Reports on each Province\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also see the majority of facility emission reports is concentrated on the same 5 Canadian provinces: Alberta, Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Because these 5 provinces filed more facility emission reports, it would be natural to expect them having more missing values.\nIn order to derive a deeper sight to understand what the data missing pattern is across the Canadian provinces, we divide the total missing values in each province by the number of reports filed by that province to attain the average number of missing values with respect to each province’s facility emission report.\n\n\nCode\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;% cbind(Average_missing = df$Province_missing/df$Num_of_Reports)\nggplot(df,\n       aes(x=Average_missing, \n           y=fct_reorder(factor(Provinces), \n                         Average_missing, \n                         .na_rm=TRUE)))+\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)+\n  xlab(\"Data Missing Density per Province\")+\n  ylab(\"Provinces\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Average Data Missing across Canadian Provinces\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(color = \"cornflowerblue\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it becomes clear from the Cleveland plot that the provinces like Nunavut, Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories etc. will have more missing values for each facility emission report they filed. This can be explained by the fact that these provinces are deep in the North and West where the data collection task is more difficult to carry out due to the severe weather condition in comparison with other southern provinces in Canada.\nNote: analyzing missing value pattern based on Canadian province is definitely not the only approach to analyze missing values in this extensive dataset. Other plausible ways could be analyzing missing value pattern for each year from 2004 to 2021, or analyzing missing value in one specific columns like Carbon dioxide in each province to develop deeper insight etc."

R is particularly adept at handling and processing data, making it an excellent choice for this task.\n\nReading the CSV Files: The read.csv() or read_csv() function in R will be used to import the datasets. The two functions are versatile and can handle various data formats and complexities.\nHandling Encoding Issues: If there are any encoding issues (common with diverse data sources), the fileEncoding parameter can be adjusted accordingly.\nData Inspection: After importing the data, functions like head(), summary(), and str() can be used to inspect the datasets. This step is crucial to understand the structure and quality of the data."

    "text": "1.1 Exploring the Impact of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Large Facilities\nIn an era where environmental consciousness is more than a mere trend but a necessity, the study of greenhouse gas emissions holds paramount importance. Our interest in addressing climate change and understanding its primary contributors led me to choose this topic for exploration. This project delves into the intricacies of greenhouse gas emissions from large facilities, leveraging two comprehensive datasets to unfold the hidden narratives and identify key trends.\nWhy This Topic?\nThe choice of this topic stems from a growing concern about the role of large facilities in global warming and other environmental concerns. These facilities, often industrial in nature, contribute significantly to the total greenhouse gas emissions, thereby affecting climate patterns, ecosystems, and health. By focusing on this area, the project aims to provide a clearer picture of where and how these emissions are generated, potentially guiding policies and practices towards a more sustainable future.Due to impracticality and over complexity to collect global facility emission datasets, we will focus on solely on Canadian facility greenhouse gas emission in recent years to align with the purpose of this project.\nDatasets at a Glance\n\nDataset 1: Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Large Facilities - This dataset provides a general account of emissions from Canadian various large facilities in 2021. It includes data points such as the quantity of emissions, the geographical location of these facilities etc.\nDataset 2: Annual Greenhouse Gas Index (2004-Present) - Offering a more detailed perspective as this dataset tracks greenhouse gas emissions over time from 2004 to 2021 with more elaborate information like different types of greenhouse gas, providing valuable insights into trends, patterns, and changes in emission levels over the years.\n\nResearch Questions\nThe project revolves around several key questions, including but may not limited to:\n\nWhat are the major types of greenhouse gases emitted by these facilities?\nWhich facilities contribute most significantly to these emissions?\nHow have emission patterns changed over time?\nAre there any geographical hotspots for high levels of emissions?\nAre there any significant regional variations in these emissions?\nHow do these emissions correlate with other environmental or economic factors?\n\nThese questions aim to uncover the underlying patterns and relationships within the data, providing a foundation for deeper environmental analysis.\nRelevance for a Broader Audience\nUnderstanding greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for a wide range of stakeholders, including policymakers, environmental scientists, and the general public. This project, through its exploratory data analysis and visualizations, intends to make this complex information accessible and insightful for everyone, irrespective of their background in environmental studies.\nBy shedding light on this critical aspect of environmental science, this project not only contributes to academic discourse but also aids in informed decision-making at various levels, from individual choices to global policies."
