    "text": "3.4 Missing value analysis\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(reshape2)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(forcats)\n\nFac_emis &lt;- read_csv(\"data/PDGES-GHGRP-GHGEmissionsGES-2004-Present.csv\", locale=locale(encoding=\"latin1\"))\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Greenhouse gas emissions from large facilities.csv\", na.strings = c(\"\", \"n/a\", \"N/A\", \"NA\"))\n\n# Create a dataframe to visualize missing values\nmissing_data &lt;- is.na(data)\n\n# Bar Plot for Missing Values\nmissing_counts &lt;- colSums(missing_data)\nmissing_df &lt;- data.frame(column = names(missing_counts), missing_count = missing_counts)\nggplot(missing_df, aes(x = reorder(column, missing_count), y = missing_count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Bar Plot of Missing Values in Each Column\", x = \"Columns\", y = \"Number of Missing Values\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Heatmap for Missing Values\nmelted_data &lt;- melt(missing_data)\nggplot(melted_data, aes(x = Var2, y = Var1)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = factor(value))) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"blue\", \"FALSE\" = \"skyblue\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Missing Values in the Dataset\", x = \"Columns\", y = \"Rows\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar plot and heat map show the missing values of Dataset 1 concentrate on 3 columns: City, Address, and Post Code. Compared with the missing values in Address and Post Code, the missing values in City are less and sparser. This data missing pattern makes sense because the three columns are all about geospatial features of the facilities. More precisely, if the city of one greenhouse gas emissions facility is missing, then the more detailed address and post code of such facility will also be missing for certain. On the other hand, even if the city is not missing, the specific address and post code of the facility could still be missing.\nThe missing values in Dataset 2 are distributed across almost all features. Hence, we decided to observe the data missing pattern with respect to each province in Canada\n\n\nCode\nProvinces &lt;- unique(Fac_emis$`Facility Province or Territory / Province ou territoire de l'installation`)\nProvince_missing &lt;- c()\nNum_of_Reports &lt;- c()\n\nfor (j in Provinces) {\n  Province_missing &lt;- append(Province_missing, sum(is.na(Fac_emis[Fac_emis$`Facility Province or Territory / Province ou territoire de l'installation` == j, ])))\n  Num_of_Reports &lt;- append(Num_of_Reports, nrow(Fac_emis[Fac_emis$`Facility Province or Territory / Province ou territoire de l'installation` == j, ]))\n}\n\n\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(Provinces, Province_missing, Num_of_Reports)\nggplot(df, aes(x = Province_missing, y = fct_reorder(factor(Provinces), \n                                                     Province_missing))) +\n  geom_col(fill='cornflowerblue') +\n  xlab(\"Missing Value Count\") +\n  ylab(\"Provinces\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Pattern in Missing values based on Canadian Provinces\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(color = \"cornflowerblue\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is, we can see the missing values are mainly from 5 Canadian provinces: Alberta, Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, Saskatchewan. However, if we count the number of filed facility emission reports from each province:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = Num_of_Reports, y = fct_reorder(factor(Provinces), \n                                                     Num_of_Reports))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  xlab(\"Number of Facility Emission Reports\") +\n  ylab(\"Provinces\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Number of Facility Emission Reports on each Province\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also see the majority of facility emission reports is concentrated on the same 5 Canadian provinces: Alberta, Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Because these 5 provinces filed more facility emission reports, it would be natural to expect them having more missing values.\nIn order to derive a deeper sight to understand what the data missing pattern is across the Canadian provinces, we divide the total missing values in each province by the number of reports filed by that province to attain the average number of missing values with respect to each province’s facility emission report.\n\n\nCode\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;% cbind(Average_missing = df$Province_missing/df$Num_of_Reports)\nggplot(df,\n       aes(x=Average_missing, \n           y=fct_reorder(factor(Provinces), \n                         Average_missing, \n                         .na_rm=TRUE)))+\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)+\n  xlab(\"Data Missing Density per Province\")+\n  ylab(\"Provinces\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Average Data Missing across Canadian Provinces\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(color = \"cornflowerblue\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it becomes clear from the Cleveland plot that the provinces like Nunavut, Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories etc. will have more missing values for each facility emission report they filed. This can be explained by the fact that these provinces are deep in the North and West where the data collection task is more difficult to carry out due to the severe weather condition in comparison with other southern provinces in Canada.\nNote: analyzing missing value pattern based on Canadian province is definitely not the only approach to analyze missing values in this extensive dataset. Other plausible ways could be analyzing missing value pattern for each year from 2004 to 2021, or analyzing missing value in one specific columns like Carbon dioxide in each province to develop deeper insight etc."

    "text": "1.1 Exploring the Impact of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Large Facilities\nIn an era where environmental consciousness is more than a mere trend but a necessity, the study of greenhouse gas emissions holds paramount importance. Our interest in addressing climate change and understanding its primary contributors led me to choose this topic for exploration. This project delves into the intricacies of greenhouse gas emissions from large facilities, leveraging two comprehensive datasets to unfold the hidden narratives and identify key trends.\nWhy This Topic?\nThe choice of this topic stems from a growing concern about the role of large facilities in global warming and other environmental concerns. These facilities, often industrial in nature, contribute significantly to the total greenhouse gas emissions, thereby affecting climate patterns, ecosystems, and health. By focusing on this area, the project aims to provide a clearer picture of where and how these emissions are generated, potentially guiding policies and practices towards a more sustainable future.Due to impracticality and over complexity to collect global facility emission datasets, we will focus on solely on Canadian facility greenhouse gas emission in recent years to align with the purpose of this project.\nDatasets at a Glance\n\nDataset 1: Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Large Facilities - This dataset provides a general account of emissions from Canadian various large facilities in 2021. It includes data points such as the quantity of emissions, the geographical location of these facilities etc.\nDataset 2: Annual Greenhouse Gas Index (2004-Present) - Offering a more detailed perspective as this dataset tracks greenhouse gas emissions over time from 2004 to 2021 with more elaborate information like different types of greenhouse gas, providing valuable insights into trends, patterns, and changes in emission levels over the years.\n\nResearch Questions\nThe project revolves around several key questions, including but may not limited to:\n\nWhat are the major types of greenhouse gases emitted by these facilities?\nWhich facilities contribute most significantly to these emissions?\nHow have emission patterns changed over time?\nAre there any geographical hotspots for high levels of emissions?\nAre there any significant regional variations in these emissions?\nHow do these emissions correlate with other environmental or economic factors?\n\nThese questions aim to uncover the underlying patterns and relationships within the data, providing a foundation for deeper environmental analysis.\nRelevance for a Broader Audience\nUnderstanding greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for a wide range of stakeholders, including policymakers, environmental scientists, and the general public. This project, through its exploratory data analysis and visualizations, intends to make this complex information accessible and insightful for everyone, irrespective of their background in environmental studies.\nBy shedding light on this critical aspect of environmental science, this project not only contributes to academic discourse but also aids in informed decision-making at various levels, from individual choices to global policies."

The visualizations will include:\n\nA bar chart showing the total emissions of each type of greenhouse gas:\n\n\n\nCode\n# Identify the columns for different greenhouse gases\nghg_columns &lt;- grep(\"tonnes CO2e\", names(df_all_factories), value = TRUE)\nghg_columns &lt;- ghg_columns[!grepl(\"Total\", ghg_columns)]\n\n# Summing up the emissions for each type of greenhouse gas\nghg_emissions &lt;- df_all_factories %&gt;%\n  select(all_of(ghg_columns)) %&gt;%\n  replace(is.na(.), 0) %&gt;%\n  summarise_all(sum)\n\n# Transforming data for ggplot\nghg_data &lt;- as.data.frame(t(ghg_emissions))\nghg_data &lt;- rownames_to_column(ghg_data, var = \"Gas\")\nghg_data$Value &lt;- as.numeric(ghg_data$V1)\nghg_data$Gas &lt;- gsub(\" \\\\(tonnes CO2e.*$\", \"\", ghg_data$Gas)\nghg_data$proportion &lt;- prop.table(ghg_data$Value)\n\n# Calculate the mean and median\nmean_value &lt;- mean(ghg_data$Value)\nmedian_value &lt;- median(ghg_data$Value)\n\n# Bar plot with auxiliary lines\nggplot(ghg_data, aes(x = reorder(Gas, -Value), y = Value)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = mean_value, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\", linewidth = 1) +  # Changed from size to linewidth\n  labs(title = \"Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Type (in CO2 equivalents)\",\n       x = \"Type of Greenhouse Gas\", y = \"Total Emissions (tonnes CO2e)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1, y = mean_value, label = paste(\"Mean:\", round(mean_value, 2)), hjust = -0.1, color = \"red\") \n\n\n\n\n\nWe can observe that without plotting CO2 (which is the largest greenhouse gas), other main types of greenhouse gas emitted by the facilities are CH4, N2O, CF4, SF4 etc.\n\nA Cleveland plot to show the relative proportion of emission for each greenhouse gas\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(ghg_data,aes(x = proportion, y=fct_reorder(factor(Gas), proportion)))+\n  geom_point()+\n  xlab(\"Emission Proportion\")+\n  ylab(\"Greenhouse Gas Types\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Emission Proportion of each Greenhouse Gas\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(color = \"lightgreen\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nThis confirms our finding that CH4, N2O, and CF4 will take up the majority of greenhouse gas emission amount without taking the most substantial CO2 into account.\nBar Chart - Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Type (in CO2 equivalents): This chart shows the total emissions of each type of greenhouse gas. It helps in identifying the gases with the highest emissions.\nCleveland Plot - Proportion of Each Greenhouse Gas in Total Emissions: This chart illustrates the relative proportions of different greenhouse gases in the total emissions. It provides a clear view of the relative contribution of each gas to the overall emissions.\nQ2: Which facilities contribute most significantly to these emissions?\nTo address the question of which facilities contribute most significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, we can analyze the two datasets with respect to facility-level emissions data. For this analysis, we will create three types of visualizations:\n\nBar Chart of Top Emitting Facilities: This chart, focusing on the facility emission dataset in 2021, will show the facilities with the highest total greenhouse gas emissions. It’s a straightforward way to identify the biggest contributors.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Remove any non-numeric characters (like commas or text), then convert to numeric\ndf_large_facilities$`Total emissions` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\"[^0-9\\\\.]\", \"\", df_large_facilities$`Total emissions`, perl = TRUE))\n\n# Handle cases where there might be NA values after conversion\ndf_large_facilities &lt;- df_large_facilities %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(`Total emissions`))\n\n# Selecting the top 100 facilities by total emissions\ntop_facilities &lt;- df_large_facilities %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(`Total emissions`)) %&gt;%\n  head(30)\n\n# Creating the bar chart\nggplot(top_facilities, aes(x = reorder(`Facility name`, `Total emissions`), y = `Total emissions`)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Top 30 Facilities by Greenhouse Gas Emissions\",\n       x = \"Facility Name\", y = \"Total Emissions (tonnes)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\n\nWarning: package 'jsonlite' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'jsonlite'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:rlang':\n\n    flatten, unbox\n\n\nCode\nbar_data = top_facilities%&gt;%\n  select(`Facility name`,`Total emissions`)\nwrite_json(bar_data,\"top_facilities.json\")\n\n\nAs we can see, the largest contributor is Mildred Lake and Aurora Plant Sites in 2021. Other high level emission facilities can also be found.\n\nHeatmap of Emissions by Facility and Gas Type: This will be a more complex visualization ,showing the contribution of each gas type by each top-emitting facility. It still considers all the facility emission on 2021 but in this case provides a more detailed breakdown of emissions (therefore using the second dataset df_all_factories containing the gas breakdown of the toal emission).\n\n\n\nCode\n# Filter and select relevant columns for the top facilities\ntop_facilities_detailed &lt;- df_all_factories %&gt;%\n  filter(`Facility Name / Nom de l'installation` %in% top_facilities$`Facility name`) %&gt;%\n  select(`Facility Name / Nom de l'installation`, `CO2 (tonnes)`, `CH4 (tonnes)`, `N2O (tonnes)`, `SF6 (tonnes)`, `HFC-134a (tonnes)`, `C2F6 (tonnes)`) %&gt;%  # Corrected the column name\n  pivot_longer(cols = -`Facility Name / Nom de l'installation`, names_to = \"Gas\", values_to = \"Emissions\")\n\n# Creating the heatmap\nggplot(top_facilities_detailed, aes(x = `Facility Name / Nom de l'installation`, y = Gas, fill = Emissions)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Emissions Breakdown by Facility and Gas Type\",\n       x = \"Facility Name\", y = \"Type of Gas\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our case, the heatmap will display emissions data by gas type for each top-emitting facility. Here’s how to interpret the heatmap in the context of Q2:\n\nAxis Labels: The x-axis represents the facility names. The y-axis represents the different types of greenhouse gases (e.g., CO2, NO2, etc.)\nColor Intensity: The color intensity in each cell of the heatmap corresponds to the emission levels. Typically, if the cell color is more close to red, it signifies higher levels of emission while if the cell color tends to blue, it signifies lower level of emission for certain gas.\nInterpreting the Data: Locate facilities with cell color more close to red, then these are the facilities contributing significantly to overall emissions. Identify which gas types have the deepest red cells across facilities. These are the gases that contribute most to emissions at each facility. We can also compare facilities to see if certain ones have higher emissions for specific gases.\nContextual Understanding: The heatmap provides a comparative view. It shows how each facility’s emissions for each gas type compare to others. For instance, we can observe that even if the facility Mildred Lake and Aurora Plant Sites has the highest total emission, its emission amount is largely concentrated on CO2. When it comes to other types of gas like NO2 and CH4, it doesn’t evince a prominent lead compared with other facilities.\nLastly, serving as one extension to the question Q2, we consider all years from 2004 to 2021 and this time we show the total amount of greenhouse gas based on the industrial sectors (English Facility NAICS Code Description) rather than specific facilities.\n\n\n\nCode\ngroup_facility &lt;- df_all_factories %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Reference Year / Année de référence`, `English Facility NAICS Code Description / Description du code SCIAN de l'installation en anglais`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_emission = sum(`Total Emissions (tonnes CO2e) / Émissions totales (tonnes éq. CO2)`)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(total_emission)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 3) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Reference Year / Année de référence'. You\ncan override using the `.groups` argument.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(group_facility, aes(x = total_emission, y=fct_reorder(factor(`English Facility NAICS Code Description / Description du code SCIAN de l'installation en anglais`), total_emission)))+\n  geom_col(fill='steelblue')+\n  xlab(\"Emission Amount\") +\n  ylab(\"Industrial Sectors\") +\n  facet_wrap(~`Reference Year / Année de référence`) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the facet bar chart, the major industrial sectors producing the most greenhouse gas are always the same across these years (Fossil-Fuel Electric Power Generation, Oil&Sand extraction, Petroleum Refine etc.) Also, even if the Fossil-Fuel Electric Power Generation sector always produces the highest amount of greenhouse gas emission each year, the specific amount of emission shows a decreasing trend from 2004 to 2021. Under the consideration that this sector is at the top of emission amount, this decreasing trend could be explained by more and more government regulation.\nQ3: How have emission patterns changed over time?\nTo analyze and visualize how emission patterns have changed over time, we can create visualizations that show trends in emissions over the years. Here we present two types of visualizations that can effectively convey this information from certain angles:\n\nTime Series Plot: This plot will show the trend of total emissions over time. It’s a straightforward way to see how the trend of emissions have changed year by year.\n\n\n\nCode\nsum_each_year &lt;- df_all_factories %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Reference Year / Année de référence`) %&gt;%\n  summarize(EmissionSum = sum(`Total Emissions (tonnes CO2e) / Émissions totales (tonnes éq. CO2)`))\n\nplot_ly(sum_each_year, x = ~`Reference Year / Année de référence`, y = ~EmissionSum, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers') %&gt;%\n  layout(title = 'Emission across the Years',\n         xaxis = list(title = 'Years'),\n         yaxis = list(title = 'Emission Amount'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis interactive time series plot shows the pattern of Canadian facility total emission amount of greenhouse gas from 2004 to 2021. The facility total emission approximately dropped from 280M to 260M on 2007 and maintained around this amount until 2016 when it rised again to almost 300M. As a matter of fact, we can further analyze this trend by displaying the total emission amount regarding to each province in Canada.\n\n\nCode\nProvince_sum_Year &lt;- df_all_factories %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Facility Province or Territory / Province ou territoire de l'installation`, `Reference Year / Année de référence`) %&gt;%\n  summarize(EmissionSum = sum(`Total Emissions (tonnes CO2e) / Émissions totales (tonnes éq. CO2)`))\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Facility Province or Territory / Province\nou territoire de l'installation'. You can override using the `.groups`\nargument.\n\n\nCode\nplot_ly(Province_sum_Year, x = ~`Reference Year / Année de référence`, y = ~EmissionSum, color = ~`Facility Province or Territory / Province ou territoire de l'installation`, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers') %&gt;%\n  layout(title = 'Yearly Emission Value for each Province',\n         xaxis = list(title = 'Years'),\n         yaxis = list(title = 'Emission Value'),\n         showlegend = TRUE)\n\n\nWarning in RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(N, \"Set2\"): n too large, allowed maximum for palette Set2 is 8\nReturning the palette you asked for with that many colors\n\nWarning in RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(N, \"Set2\"): n too large, allowed maximum for palette Set2 is 8\nReturning the palette you asked for with that many colors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trend we can observe is the facility emission amount of Alberta shows an increasing trend from 2004 to 2021 whereas the emission amount in the province Ontario shows a decreasing trend even if this decreasing trend seems to halt after 2015. Other Canadian provinces have less emission amount (ranging from 0 to 30M) compared with these two provinces and they do not have much variation in their emission amount across these years.\n\nStacked Area Chart: This chart will display the breakdown of emissions by gas type over time, allowing you to see not only the total emissions but also how the composition of emissions has changed.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Define the year column and gas columns\nyear_column &lt;- \"Reference Year / Année de référence\"\ngas_columns &lt;- c(\"CH4 (tonnes)\", \"N2O (tonnes)\", \"CF4 (tonnes)\", \"SF6 (tonnes)\", \"HFC-134a (tonnes)\", \"C2F6 (tonnes)\")\nyear_col &lt;- sym(year_column)\n\ngas_col &lt;- sym(\"CO2 (tonnes)\")\n\nlong_format &lt;- df_all_factories %&gt;%\n  select(!!year_col, !!gas_col) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -!!year_col, names_to = \"Gas\", values_to = \"Emissions\")\n\nfor(gas_column in gas_columns) {\n  \n  gas_col &lt;- sym(gas_column)\n  \n  new_long_format &lt;- df_all_factories %&gt;%\n    select(!!year_col, !!gas_col) %&gt;%\n    pivot_longer(cols = -!!year_col, names_to = \"Gas\", values_to = \"Emissions\")\n  \n  long_format &lt;- rbind(long_format, new_long_format)\n\n}\n  \n  \nggplot(long_format, aes(x = `Reference Year / Année de référence`, y = Emissions, fill = Gas)) +\n  geom_area(position = 'stack') +\n  labs(title = paste(\"Different Types of Facility Emission Over Time\"),\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Emissions (tonnes)\") +\n  facet_wrap(~Gas, scale=\"free\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Spectral\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the 7 gases we showed above, we can observe some interesting patterns that CO2 emission drops substantially roughly after 2013, CH4 emission amount has increased since 2011, C2F6 and CF4 never play an important role in greenhouse gas emission amount etc.\nIn these visualizations: - The time series plot provides a clear view of the overall trend in emissions. - The stacked area chart shows how the proportion of different gases in the total emissions has evolved over time.\nQ4: Are there any geographical hotspots for high levels of emissions?\nTo analyze and visualize geographical hotspots for high levels of emissions, we can create maps that highlight areas with significant emission levels. Since we have emissions data from large facilities in Canada, we can use this data along with the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each facility to create these visualizations.\nHere are the visualizations we can create:\n\nChoropleth Map: This map will color-code Canadian provinces or territories based on the total emissions from facilities within each region.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Load geographical data for Canadian provinces\ncanada_provinces &lt;- ne_states(country = \"canada\", returnclass = \"sf\")\n\n# Aggregate emissions by province\nemissions_by_province &lt;- df_all_factories %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Facility Province or Territory / Province ou territoire de l'installation`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total_Emissions = sum(`Total Emissions (tonnes CO2e) / Émissions totales (tonnes éq. CO2)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Join with geographical data\nmap_data &lt;- left_join(canada_provinces, emissions_by_province, by = c(\"name\" = \"Facility Province or Territory / Province ou territoire de l'installation\"))\n\n# Plot the choropleth map\nchoropleth_map &lt;- ggplot(map_data) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = Total_Emissions)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Total Emissions\\n(tonnes CO2e)\") +\n  labs(title = \"Total Emissions by Province in Canada\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nprint(choropleth_map)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can observe that the major emission is concentrated on lower latitudes in the inland provinces like Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan etc.\n\nBubble Map: This map will plot each facility as a bubble on a map of Canada, with the bubble size representing the emission levels of each facility.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create bubble charts showing emissions per facility\nbubble_map &lt;- ggplot(df_all_factories, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, size = `Total Emissions (tonnes CO2e) / Émissions totales (tonnes éq.

CO2)`)\ncolnames(bubble_data) = c(\"Longitude\",\"Latitude\",\"rate\")\n# Write to a JSON file\nwrite_json(bubble_data, \"bubble_data.json\", pretty = TRUE)\n\n\nThis bubble plot further confirms our finding that the lower latitude inland regions in Canada should account for the major greenhouse gas emission amount.\nIn these visualizations: - The choropleth map provides an overview of emissions by province. - The bubble map shows the precise locations of high-emission facilities.\nAs an extension to this question Q4, we can further investigate if there is any regional emission variation across these years\n\nHexagonal heatmap: facet by years, this hexagonal plot shows the number of facility emission reports collected based on different regions in Canada.\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_all_factories, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude))+\n  geom_hex(binwidth = 10, na.rm = TRUE)+\n  scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"Reds\", direction = 1)+\n  xlab(\"Longitude\")+\n  ylab(\"Latitude\")+\n  facet_wrap(~`Reference Year / Année de référence`)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n  ggtitle(\"Hexagonal Heatmap of bin Counts\")\n\n\n$title\n[1] \"Hexagonal Heatmap of bin Counts\"\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"labels\"\n\n\nNumber of facility emission reports being collected is higher at the southern part of Canada(regions of low latitude). Moreover, based on the facet hex plot, this variation becomes more noticeable and distinct year over year, which means the more greenhouse gas emission facilities are established in the south than in the north. Therefore, this might explain why we saw the phenomenon that majority of facility emission is concentrated in the south. If we further explore the specific amount of greenhouse gas emission:\n\nSquare heatmap: this heatmap will show how the facility emission amount evolved over the year regarding to different regions in Canada.\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_all_factories, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, weights = `Total Emissions (tonnes CO2e) / Émissions totales (tonnes éq. CO2)`)) + \n  geom_bin2d(bins = 5) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"Reds\", direction = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~`Reference Year / Année de référence`) +\n  labs(x=\"Longitude\",\n       y=\"Latitude\",\n       title = \"Greenhouse Gas Emission Amount\",\n       fill = \"Emission Amount\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heatmap confirms our previous finding that the southern and middle regions (lower latitudes and in-between longitudes) have more greenhouse gas emission, but it also shows that along with the increase of the number of facilities(increased number of facility emission reports), the facility emission amount in the southern regions did increase but not in a very significant way as we compare the regions with high latitudes and low latitudes."

    "text": "Lessons Learned: The greenhouse gas from facility emission in Canada is mainly composed of CO2, CH4, N2O, CF4 etc. In order to address the environmental issue caused by greenhouse gas, these major components of the emission should be concentrated on.\nWe also discovered which facilities or which industrial sectors actually contribute most emission, these facilities and industrial sectors should be aimed if Canadian government will announce more regulations and policies in the future.\nThe greenhouse gas emission generally shows an increasing trend across these years and the majority of the emission comes from the low latitude inland provinces.\nConcession/Limitation: Much more detailed analysis is yet to be achieved. For example, Will it produce us with more insights if we use the Statebins for the last part of the question to figure out the regional difference in greenhouse gas emission, what if we use the parallel coordinate plots to figure out the relationship among the emission of different gases (like does the emission amount of CH4 is negatively correlated with the emission amount of N2O etc.), or even use the facet plot to observe the emission amount of one specific gas like N2O in each Canadian province.\nfuture directions: The two extensive datasets actually could provide audience much more insights than what we just showed. Some of the valuable questions like above we left unanswered are possible theme for interested audience to further explore. Furthermore, because these two datasets are only about the facility emission in Canada, a similar analysis could be conducted on the other countries around the world to evaluate greenhouse gas emission and possibly correlated environmental issues."
